# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Iris Dataset

## Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding and analyzing datasets. In this project, we perform EDA on the famous Iris dataset, aiming to gain insights into the characteristics of different iris plant species.

## About
This repository contains code and resources for conducting exploratory data analysis on the Iris dataset. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, we aim to uncover patterns, relationships, and interesting observations within the data.

## Key Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Summary statistics
- Univariate and multivariate analysis
- Data visualization using plots and charts
- Correlation analysis
- Insights into the characteristics of iris plant species

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It consists of 150 samples, each representing an iris plant, with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a target variable indicating the species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica).

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Explore the Jupyter Notebook in the `analysis` directory to understand the EDA process.
4. Run the code cells to replicate the analysis and visualize the insights.
